"""Bot commands for csp-bot.

Commands can leverage chatom's cross-platform features for
mentions, formatting, and entity recognition.

Two command APIs are available:

1. ``@command`` decorator for stateless function-based commands
2. ``Command`` BaseModel subclass for stateful class-based commands

The legacy ``BaseCommand`` hierarchy is still supported via
``LegacyCommandAdapter``.
